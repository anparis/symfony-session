# Goal : Build a session inscription management website

We should be able to as user :
- add/delete/edit sessions/interns/modules/categories
- access content when connected (confirm registration with an email)
- add modules/interns to a session

## How did I orgranized the website
The most important thing to display when user is connected was all the sessions, bc the user needs to quickly see which sessions are full or available.

From there we can go to all the sessions and their informations, in order to register some interns or add some modules.


## Challenges I've had
- Block new interns inscription when the session is full
- Find the right dql query to list modules and interns not registered in the session
-
